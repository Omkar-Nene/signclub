# SignClub - Deployment Guide

Complete guide to deploying SignClub to Chrome Web Store and managing the GitHub repository.

## Part 1: Prepare for Deployment

### Step 1: Clean the Project

Remove development files that shouldn't be in production:

```bash
# Remove node_modules (not needed for extension)
rm -rf node_modules

# Remove package files (optional - only needed if you use npm)
# rm package.json package-lock.json
```

### Step 2: Verify Files

Your final extension should contain ONLY these files:
```
quick_sign_app/
├── manifest.json              ✅ Required
├── popup.html                 ✅ Required
├── popup.js                   ✅ Required
├── background.js              ✅ Required
├── content-google-docs.js     ✅ Required
├── favicon-256.png            ✅ Required
├── README.md                  ✅ For GitHub
├── CHANGELOG.md               ✅ For GitHub
└── .gitignore                 ✅ For GitHub
```

**Do NOT include:**
- ❌ node_modules/
- ❌ .git/ (will be separate)
- ❌ package.json / package-lock.json (optional)

  manifest.json \
  popup.html \
  popup.js \
  background.js \
  content-google-docs.js \
  favicon-256.png

# Verify ZIP contents
unzip -l signclub-v1.0.0.zip
```

### Option B: Manual (Any OS)

1. Create a new folder called `signclub-extension`
2. Copy ONLY these files into it:
   - manifest.json
   - popup.html
   - popup.js
   - background.js
   - content-google-docs.js
   - favicon-256.png
3. Right-click the folder → Compress/Create Archive
